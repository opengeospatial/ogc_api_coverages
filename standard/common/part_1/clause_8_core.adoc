== Requirements Class "Platform"

The Platform Requirements Class defines a set of common capabilities which are applicable to any OGC Web API. Those capabilities provide the platform upon which resource-specific APIs can be built. This section describes those capabilities and any modifications needed to better support Coverage resources.

[[resource-requirements-section]]
=== Resource Requirements

The `platform` resources are introduced in <<core-resources-table>>. The requirements and recommendations applicable to these resources are provided in this sections below.

[[landing-page]]
==== API landing page

A Web API has a single landing page on the `{root}` node.

The purpose of the landing page is to provide clients with a starting point for using the API. Any resource exposed through an API can be accessed by following paths or links starting from the landing page.

The landing page includes three metadata elements; title, description, and attribution. These three elements describe the API as a whole. Clients can expect to encounter metadata which is more resource-specific as they follow links and paths from the landing page. 

While the three metadata elements are defined as text strings, the attribution element is special. Specifically, it can contain markup text. Markup allows a text string to import images and format text. The capabilities are only limited by the markup language used. See the example <<json-landing-page,landing page>> for an example of the use of markup in the attribution element.

It is recommended that OGC Web APIs provide a set of Service Metadata which identifies the service and provides information about the service provider.     

include::recommendations/core/REC_service-metadata.adoc[]

Additional information about Service Metadata can be found in the http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-071.html#service-metadata-section[OAPI-Common Users Guide].

Examples of OGC landing pages are provided in <<landing-page-examples>>.

In addition to the required resources, links to additional resources may be included in the Landing Page.

===== Error Situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

[[api-definition]]
==== API Definition

Every API should provide an API Definition resource which describes capabilities provided by that API. This resource can be used by developers to understand the API, by software clients to connect to the server, and by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

[[conformance-classes]]
==== Declaration of Conformance Classes

The OGC Web API Standards define a collection of modules which can be assembled into a Web API. The first question a client will ask when accessing one of these APIs is "what are you?" In other words, what modules were used to create you? Since implementors have a choice on which modules to use, there is no simple answer. The best that can be done is to provide a list of the modules implemented, a declaration of the Conformance Classes.

The list of Conformance Classes is key to understanding and using an OGC Web API. So it is important that they are easy to access. A simple GET using an easily constructed URL is all that should be required. Therefore, the path to the Conformance Declaration is fixed.

Ease of access is also supported by the structure of the Conformance Declaration resource. It is a simple list of URIs. This is a structure that requires almost no parsing and little interpretation. Designed to be accessible to even the simplest client.

The Conformance Declaration resource returned by this operation is based on the following link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/openapi/schemas/confClasses.json[Conformance Declaration Schema]. 

Examples of OGC Conformance Declarations are provided in <<conformance-response-examples>>.
