^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/geodata/rc-md-extent* 
^|A |For each spatial resource collection, the ``extent`` property, if provided, SHALL define boundaries that encompass the spatial and temporal properties of all of the resources in this collection. The temporal extent may use ``null`` values to indicate an open time interval.
^|B |If a spatial resource has multiple properties with spatial or temporal information, it is the decision of the API implementation whether only a single spatial or temporal geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
