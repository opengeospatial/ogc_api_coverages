^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/geodata/rc-bbox-response*
^|A|If the ``bbox`` parameter is provided by the client and supported by the server, then only resources that have a spatial geometry that intersects the bounding box SHALL be part of the result set.
^|B|If a resource has multiple spatial geometry properties, it is the decision of the server whether only a single spatial geometry property is used to determine the extent or all relevant geometries.
^|C|The ``bbox`` parameter SHALL also match all resources in the collection that are not associated with a spatial geometry.
^|D|The bounding box is provided as four or six numbers, depending on whether the coordinate reference system includes a vertical axis (height or depth):

* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
* Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
* Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

^|E|The values for the CRS axis 1 and 2 SHALL be interpreted as WGS84 longitude/latitude (http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84) unless a  different coordinate reference system is specified in a parameter `bbox-crs`.
^|F|The coordinate values SHALL be within the extent specified for the coordinate reference system.
