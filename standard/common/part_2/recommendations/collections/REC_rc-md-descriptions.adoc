^|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |*/rec/geodata/rc-md-descriptions* 
^|A |If external schemas or descriptions exist that provide additional information about the structure or semantics for the resource, a `200`-response SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property of the response (relation: `describedBy`).
^|B |The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link. This applies to resources that describe the whole dataset.
