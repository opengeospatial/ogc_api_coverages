[[collection-access-section]]
== Requirements Class "GeoData"

OGC Web API Standards start with the assumption that geospatial resources are organized into collections. An API will expose one or more collections. The GeoData Conformance Class defines how to organize and provide access to a collection of collections.

This Requirements Class describes the resources and operations used to discover and query resource collections exposed through an OGC Web API. It does not include any requirements about how resources are aggregated into collections nor about the aggregated resources themselves. That detail is reserved for resource-specific OGC Web API standards.

The three resources defined in this Requirements Class are summarized in <<collection-resources>>. Detailed requirements for each of these resources are provided in the <<collection-resource-requirements,Resource Requirements>> section.

|===

This Requirements Class also describes the operations which can be performed on these resources. Requirements for these operations are included with their associated resource descriptions in the <<collection-resource-requirements,Resource Requirements>> section. 

Three parameters are defined for use in these operations. These parameters are documented in the <<parameter-requirements,Parameter Requirements>> section. A summary of the parameters is provided in <<parameter-summary>>.

[[collection-resource-requirements]]
=== Resource Requirements

This section expresses the requirements for resources and operations used to discover and query resource collections.

[[collections-metadata]]
==== Collections Metadata

OGC APIs typically organize their Spatial Resources into collections. Information about those collections is accessed through the `/collections` path.

===== Operation

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-op.adoc[]

===== Parameters

The following query parameters can be used with this operation:

* <<bbox-parameter-requirements,Bounding Box>>: Limits the contents of the `collections` element to those collections whose spatial extent intersects the bounding box specified by the Bounding Box parameter.
* <<datetime-parameter-requirements,Date Time>> Limits the contents of the `collections` element to those collections whose temporal extent intersects the instance or period specified by the Date Time parameter. 
* <<limit-parameter-requirements,Limit>>: Limits the contents of the `collections` element to the number of items specified by the Limit parameter.

===== Response

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-success.adoc[]

The collections metadata returned by this operation is based on the link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/schemas/collections.json[collections.json] JSON schema. Examples of collections metadata are provided in <<collections-metadata-examples>>.

.collections.json
[source, JSON]
include::openapi/schemas/collections.json[]

This schema is further constrained by the following requirements and recommendations.

To support hypermedia navigation, the `links` property must be populated with sufficient hyperlinks to navigate through the whole dataset.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-links.adoc[]

Additional information may be available to assist in understanding and using this dataset. Links to those resources should be provided as well.

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-md-descriptions.adoc[]

The `timeStamp` property of the Collections Metadata indicates when the response was generated.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-timeStamp.adoc[]

The `collections` property of the Collections Metadata provides a description of each individual collection hosted by the API. These descriptions are based on the link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/schemas/collectionDesc.json[Collection Description Schema]. This schema is described in detail in the <<collection-description, Collection Description>> section of this Standard. 

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-items.adoc[]

A client may select a subset of the hosted collections using the <<bbox-parameter-requirements,`bbox`>> and the <<datetime-parameter-requirements,`datetime`>> parameter. These parameters are evaluated against the `extent` element of the Collection Description for each collection.

The requirements governing the processing of these parameters are:

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-bbox-collections-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-bbox-collections-response.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-time-collections-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-time-collections-response.adoc[]

The number of collections returned in a response may be further limited by the client using the `limit` parameter. When applied against the `/collections` resource, the <<limit-parameter-requirements,`limit`>> parameter indicates the maximum number of collections which should be included in a single response.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-limit-collections-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-limit-collections-response.adoc[]

The `numberMatched` property of the Collections Metadata indicates the number of collection descriptions included in the Collections Metadata. This may be a subset of the total set of collections hosted by the API. Selection of which collections to include in a subset is controled through the <<bbox-parameter-requirements,`bbox`>>, <<datetime-parameter-requirements,`datetime`>> and other selection parameters provided by the client.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-numberMatched.adoc[]

The Collections Metadata response should describe all of the collections that meet the client's selection criteria. However, in some cases that is impractical. An API implementation has the option of limiting the size of the Collections Metadata response.  

include::recommendations/collections/PER_rc-md-items.adoc[]

The number of collection descriptions included in a Collections Metadata response may be a subset of the number matched. In that case, the `numberReturned` property of the Collections Metadata indicates the number of collection descriptions returned in this "page" of the Collections Metadata. 

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-numberReturned.adoc[]

If the Collections Metadata contains a subset of the selected collection descriptions (numberReturned is less than numberMatched) then the Collections Metadata should contain links for navigating to the rest of the collection descriptions as described in the <<limit-parameter-requirements,limit parameter>> section.

===== Error situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

[[collection-description]]
==== Collection Description

Each resource collection is described by a set of metadata. That metadata is accessed directly using the `/collections/{collectionId}` path or as an entry in the `collections` property of the Collections Metadata resource.

===== Operation

include::requirements/collections/REQ_src-md-op.adoc[]

===== Parameters

No parameters have been standardized for this operation.

===== Response

include::requirements/collections/REQ_src-md-success.adoc[]

Collection Descriptions are based on the link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/schemas/collectionDesc.json[Collection Description Schema]. Examples of Collection Descriptions are provided in <<collection-description-examples>>.

.Collection Description Schema
[source, JSON]
include::openapi/schemas/collectionDesc.json[]

The purpose of the Collection Description is to provide clients with a basic understanding of a single collection. It also serves as a starting point for further navigation through the collection. Many of the properties of the Collection Description are self-explanitory. However, a few call for additional explanation.

====== Attribution

The attribution element is a special type of string property. Specifically, it can contain markup text. Markup allows a text string to import images and format text. The capabilities are only limited by the markup language used. See the example <<collection-description-examples,collection description>> for an example of the use of markup in the attribution element.

====== Item Type

A Collection Description describes a collection of items. The itemType property identifies the type of item which has been collected.

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-md-item-type.adoc[]

====== Links

To support hypermedia navigation, the `links` property must be populated with sufficient hyperlinks to navigate through the whole dataset.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-items-links.adoc[]

Additional information may be available to assist in understanding and using this dataset. Links to those resources should be provided as well.

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-md-items-descriptions.adoc[]

====== Extent

The extent property defines a spatial-temporal surface which encompasses all of the items in the collection. Since not all collections are nicely clustered around a single place in space and time, the extent property provides flexibility in how that surface can be defined. 

* Bbox provides a set of rectangular bounding boxes which use geographic coordinates to envelope portions of the collection. Typically only the first element would be populated. Additional boxes may be useful, for example, when the collection is clustered in multiple, widely-separated locations. 
* Envelope addresses the case where the explicit identification of axis is desired. Indoor navigation, for example, may use this option.
* Interval provides a set of temporal periods. Typically only the first temporal period would be populated. However, like bbox, additional periods can be added if the collection does not form a single temporal cluster.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-md-extent.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-md-extent.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-md-extent-single.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/PER_rc-md-extent-extensions.adoc[]

===== Error situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

If the parameter `collectionId` does not exist on the server, the status code of the response will be `404` (see <<status-codes>>).

[[collection-resource]]
==== Collection Resource

A collection resource is the content of the collection as opposed to metadata about that collection. This standard defines the general behavior of this operation, but detailed requirements are the purview of the API standard for that resource type.

===== Operation

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-op.adoc[]

===== Parameters

The following parameters may be used with this operation:

* <<bbox-parameter-requirements,Bounding Box>>: Selects items from the collection whose spatial extent intersects the bounding box specified by the Bounding Box parameter.
* <<datetime-parameter-requirements,Date Time>> Selects items from the collection whose temporal extent intersects the instance or period specified by the Date Time parameter. 
* <<limit-parameter-requirements,Limit>>: Limits the size of the response to the number of items specified by the Limit parameter.

NOTE: Since the type of resource which makes up the collection is not defined, the behavior of any parameters must be tailored to the structure and information content of specific resource types. That tailoring will take place in resource-specific OGC API standards.

===== Response

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-bbox-items-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-time-items-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-limit-items-unsupported.adoc[]

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-response.adoc[]

===== Error situations

See <<http-status-codes>> for general guidance.

[[parameter-requirements]]
=== Parameter Requirements

Query parameters are used in URLs to limit the resources which are returned on a GET request. The GeoData Requirements Class defines three query parameters for use in OGC API standards:

* <<bbox-parameter-requirements,bbox>>: Bounding Box
* <<parameter-datetime-requirements,datetime>>: Date and Time
* <<limit-parameter-requirements,limit>>: Response resource count limit

The behavior generated by these parameters is specific to the operation and resource upon which they are applied. Those behaviors are described for each resource type and operation in the <<collection-resource-requirements,Resource Requirements>> section.

Use of these query parameters with any specific operation is optional. Developers of API-GeoData servers should document their supported parameters in the API definition as describe in the <<api-platform-section,Platform Requirements Class>>.

[[bbox-parameter-requirements]]
==== Parameter bbox

The `bbox` parameter is defined as follows:

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-bbox-definition.adoc[]

While the processing of the `bbox` parameter is specific to the resource and operation for which it is applied, there is a general set of requirements which all implementations must address.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-bbox-response.adoc[]

"Intersects" means that a coordinate that is part of the spatial geometry of the resource falls within the area specified in the parameter `bbox`. This includes the boundaries of the geometries. For curves the boundary includes the start and end position. For surfaces the boundary includes the outer and inner rings.

In case of a degenerate bounding box, the resulting geometry is used. For example, if the lower left corner is the same as the upper right corner, all resources match where the geometry intersects with this point.

This standard does not specify requirements for the parameter `bbox-crs`. Those requirements will be specified in a later version of this standard.

For WGS 84 longitude/latitude the bounding box is in most cases the sequence of minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude. However, in cases where the box spans the anti-meridian (180th meridian) the first value (west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

.The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone
=================
The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in WGS84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S) would be represented in JSON as `[ 160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89 ]` and in a query as `bbox=160.6,-55.95,-170,-25.89`.
=================

Note that the server will return an error if a latitude value of ``160.0`` is used.

If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to OpenAPI 3.0 is available at link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/parameters/bbox.yaml[bbox.yaml].

[[datetime-parameter-requirements]]
==== Parameter datetime

The `datetime` parameter is defined as follows:

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-time-definition.adoc[]

While the processing of the `datetime` parameter is specific to the resource and operation for which it is applied, there is a general set of requirements which all implementations must address.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-time-response.adoc[]

"Intersects" means that the time (instant or period) specified in the parameter `datetime` includes a timestamp that is part of the temporal geometry of the resource (again, a time instant or period). For time periods this includes the start and end time.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|====
| Note | ISO 8601-2 distinguishes open start/end timestamps (double-dot) and unknown start/end timestamps (empty string). For queries, an unknown start/end has the same effect as an open start/end.
|====

.A date-time
=================
February 12, 2018, 23:20:52 GMT:

`time=2018-02-12T23%3A20%3A52Z`
=================

For resources with a temporal property that is a timestamp (like `lastUpdate`), a date-time value would match all resources where the temporal property is identical.

For resources with a temporal property that is a date or a time interval, a date-time value would match all resources where the timestamp is on that day or within the time interval.

.Intervals
=================
February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 GMT to March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 GMT:

`datetime=2018-02-12T00%3A00%3A00Z%2F2018-03-18T12%3A31%3A12Z`

February 12, 2018, 00:00:00 UTC or later:

`datetime=2018-02-12T00%3A00%3A00Z%2F..`

March 18, 2018, 12:31:12 UTC or earlier:

`datetime=..%2F2018-03-18T12%3A31%3A12Z`
=================

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to OpenAPI 3.0 is available at link:http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part2/1.0/parameters/datetime.yaml[datetime.yaml].

[[limit-parameter-requirements]]
==== Parameter limit

The `limit` parameter limits the number of resources that can be returned in a single response.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-limit-definition.adoc[]

While the processing of the `limit` parameter is specific to the resource and operation for which it is applied, there is a general set of requirements which all implementations must address.

include::requirements/collections/REQ_rc-limit-response.adoc[]

The number of resources returned depends on the server and the value of the `limit` parameter.

*   The client can request a limit to the number of resources returned.
*   The server may have a default value for the limit, and a maximum limit.
*   If the server has any more results available than it returns (the number it returns is less than or equal to the requested/default/maximum limit) then the server will include a link to the next set of results.

include::recommendations/collections/PER_rc-server-limit.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-server-limit.adoc[]

The effect of the limit parameter is to divide the response into a number of pages. Each page (except for the last) contains the specified number of entities. The response contains the first `page`. Additional pages can be accessed through hyperlink navigation.

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-next-1.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-next-2.adoc[]

include::recommendations/collections/REC_rc-next-3.adoc[]

Providing `prev` links supports navigating back and forth between pages, but depending on the implementation approach it may be too complex to implement.

include::recommendations/collections/PER_rc-prev.adoc[]
