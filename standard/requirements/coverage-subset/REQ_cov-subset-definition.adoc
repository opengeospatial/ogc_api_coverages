^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/coverage-subset/definition*
^|A |The operation SHALL support a parameter `subset` with the following characteristics (using an Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF) fragment):

[source,EBNF]
----
  SubsetSpec:        "subset"=axisName(intervalOrPoint)
  axisName:          {text}
  intervalOrPoint:   interval \| point
  interval:          low : high
  low:               point \| *
  high:              point \| *
  point:             {number} \| "{text}"

  Where:
     \" = double quote = ASCII code 0x42,
     {number} is an integer or floating-point number, and
     {text} is some general ASCII text (such as a time and date notation in ISO 8601).
----
^|B |The axis name SHALL be the same as one of the `axisLabels` defined in the DomainSet or else return a 400 status code.
^|C |If the intervalOrPoint values fall entirely outside the range of valid values defined by the DomainSet for the identified axis,a 204 status code SHALL be returned
^|D |For a CRS where an axis can wrap around, such as subsetting across the dateline (anti-meridian) in a geographic CRS, a `low` value greater than `high` SHALL
be supported to indicate an extent crossing that wrapping point.
|===

NOTE: When the intervalOrPoint values fall partially outside of the range of valid values defined by the DomainSet for the identified axis,
the service is expected to return the non-empty portion of the coverage resulting from the subset.
For subsetting on the range set, and for coverage media types with no geo-referencing mechanisms (e.g. PNG), NO_DATA values or transparency should be used.
If a georeferencing mechanism is available within the negotiated media type, the service could decide whether to use NO_DATA values
or simply return the properly geo-referenced values within the domain set.
