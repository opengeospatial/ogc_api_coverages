^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/coverage-tiles/success*
^|A |The responses for the list of tilesets, tileset metadata and tiles SHALL comply to all requirements of the OGC API - Tiles specifications
^|B |The response to a request for an individual tile SHALL return a subset of the coverage trimmed on the axes defined by the 2D Tile Matrix Set
to cover the exact geospatial extent of the tile.
^|C |The response to a request for an individual tile SHALL be scaled down to a number of cells corresponding to the tile's pixel size,
   plus one if the coverage cells do not fully span the distance between them.
|===

As an example, considering that the WorldCRS84Quad Tile Matrix Set has tile pixel sizes defined as 256 x 256,
a request for tile .../coverage/tiles/WorldCRS84Quad/1/0/0 of a point coverage is equivalent to:

   .../coverage?subset=Lat(0:90),Lon(-180:-90)&scaleSize=257,257

and returns a tile containing 257 x 257 cells, while for an area coverage it is equivalent to:

   .../coverage?subset=Lat(0:90),Lon(-180:-90)&scaleSize=256,256

and returns a tile containing 256 x 256 cells.
