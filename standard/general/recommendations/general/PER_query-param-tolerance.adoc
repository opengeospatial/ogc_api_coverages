^|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |*/per/general/query-param-tolerance*
^|A |Servers MAY display tolerance for requests with incorrect query parameters. These acts of tolerance include:  

*   accept alternate capitalizations, spellings, and/or aliases of parameters,
*   ignore unknown/unrecognized parameters,
*   return a response with a status code of 30x redirecting the client to a more correct version of the request.
^|B |Servers should not be excessively tolerant. The response a client receives from the server should be a reasonable response for the request submitted.
